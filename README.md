# Yoda Theme for VS Code

![Yoda Theme](https://github.com/Sire/Yoda/raw/refs/heads/main/Yoda-Theme-VSCode-Sire.png)

A dark VS Code theme that balances beauty with usability.

Carefully crafted to highlight what truly matters using vibrant, saturated colors, while gently dimming less important elements â€” bringing order to your code, and peace to your eyes. 

Approved by Yoda, it is.

## Troubleshooting

- If you don't get full color syntax highlighting, make sure you have [Semantic Highlighting](vscode://settings/editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled) set to configuredByTheme, or enabled.
- [OmniSharp Semantic Highlitning](vscode://settings/csharp.semanticHighlighting.enabled) should not be needed.
- If nested braces are different colors depending on depth, you might have enabled [Bracket Pair Colorization](vscode://settings/editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled) in your settings.

**Enjoy!**
