# Yoda Theme for VS Code

![Yoda Theme C# Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sire/Yoda/main/images/Yoda-Theme-Example.png)

A dark VS Code theme that balances beauty with usability.

Carefully crafted to highlight what truly matters using vibrant, saturated colors, while gently dimming less important elements â€” bringing order to your code, and peace to your eyes.

*Approved by Yoda, it is.*

## Installation

- In VSCode, go to Extensions / Search for "Yoda Theme" / Install
- Install from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoda.yoda-theme)

## Troubleshooting

- If you don't get full color syntax highlighting, make sure you have [Semantic Highlighting](vscode://settings/editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled) set to configuredByTheme, or enabled.
- [OmniSharp Semantic Highlitning](vscode://settings/csharp.semanticHighlighting.enabled) should not be needed.
- If nested braces are different colors depending on depth, you might have enabled [Bracket Pair Colorization](vscode://settings/editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled) in your settings.
